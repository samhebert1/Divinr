## Spreads

### Four Point Spread

this view lays out four random tarot cards according to a basic four card reflection of the querent's current state. The cards are laid out accordingly:

#### **Fire | Soul/Psyche | ψυχῇ**

- The querent's identity, the state of the soul at the queried time. this card position describes the current state of the querent's passion, drive, identity, and sense of self. The underlying meaning of this position (in this app) is what Jesus Christ referred to when he said to love God with all your *'soul' (greek: ψυχῇ || 'psyche').*

#### **Air | Thoughts | διανοίᾳ**

- The current state of the querant's thought life. This position is inspired by when Jesus Christ said to love God with all your *'mind' (greek: διανοίᾳ || 'dianoia').*
  
#### **Water | Heart | καρδίας**

- the querant's emotions and feelings; The 'heart' or καρδίας. Inspired once again by Jesus' aforementioned command.
  
#### **Earth | Physical/Presence | ἰσχύϊ**

- the querant's current immmediate physical and environmental state. This position describes the current interface between the querant and their material environnment. It describes the state of their impact or force upon the earth, and/or the impact of the world on their strength. It is inspired by Christ when he said to love God with all your *'strength' (greek: ἰσχύϊ || 'ischui' ).*

### Twelve House Spread

The twelve house spread uses the astrological houses of the zodiac to describe the intricate domains of the querant's current life. This spread displays 12 cards (one for each house). it includes a brief description of the meaning of each house. The card  is read in context to the residing house in which it is pulled.

## @TODO

- [ ] Fix the border/padding in the four point view so that  `overflow: hidden` is not causing problems with card border.
- [ ] Add a one card spread option.
- [ ] Add a five card spread.
- [ ] Add a overview displaying all pulled cards at a glance for the four-card spread.
- [ ] Consider adding a footer.
- [ ] Forgot to add a 'Clear' button to `app.component`.
